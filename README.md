<h3>Week 1</h3>
<br>
Definition of Ready<br>
A feature is ready when it is one of the top priorities, it has defined acceptance criteria and it doesnâ€™t pose a high risk to the other features
It also needs an estimated time.
<br>

Definition of Done
A feature is done when it has been implemented according to the acceptance criteria and has been tested and reviewed by another member of the team
Additionally a feature is done when it has been pushed to the master version and is officially part of the final build
<br>
